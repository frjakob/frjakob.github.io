    <h3>
      Your company's success is driven by each of your employee's understanding of the value chain. In this world of
      ever-increasing competition, there is no room for non-value additive activities and bureaucratic thinking.&nbsp;
    </h3>

    <h4>
      &rdquo;In his first project as Interim Manager with us, Frank Jakob has instantly identified weaknesses and
      highlighted potential for improvements. Effortlessly, he convinced and motivated management and employees of his
      ideas. Thanks to his structured approach, his deep knowledge of SAP and his strong network with clients, he was
      able to motivate the management and the employees to consistently expand the SCM.&rdquo;<BR>Dr. Christian Frank,
      Partner and member of the Executive Board, Atreus GmbH</h4>

    <h2>Sourcing</h2>

    <h3>
      Efficient and effective sourcing is decisive for the competitive positioning of your company. At the interface
      between product development, manufacturing, sales and supply, the challenges for the sourcing department are
      becoming more and more complex and diverse. Having the right tools to measure and control the processes is as
      important as having a well-trained and highly motivated team.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Step by step through the value chain, I will support you with analysis, a purposeful concept and the
      implementation of an improved sourcing and outsourcing operation.
    </h3>
    <h4>
      &rdquo;Frank Jakob has managed to nearly half our costs for import/export freights in his role as interim purchase
      manager. His analysis was exact, and his conclusions spot on. He handled the delicate tendering process, as well
      as the implementation phase with care, and avoided potential disappointment with existing suppliers. His concept
      and the choices he has made were so profound, that one year later, we handed over domestic transport to the same
      service provider.&rdquo;<BR> Harald Tiemann, CEO, GWF AG
    </h4>
    <H4>
      &rdquo;Frank Jakob analysed all our needs of machined steel castings for our 5 subsidiaries in Germany, England,
      USA, Canada and Mexico in order to work out cost reduction. For the transfer of the first category to an Indian
      supplier he was fully responsible. The cost reduction was 50%. He prepared two other categories in a way so that
      we were able to do the transfer on our own.&rdquo;<BR> Hagen Alexander, Sulzer Ltd. Head of Advance and
      Operational Procurement EMEA
    </h4>
    <H4>
      &rdquo;Frank Jakob was chosen for outsourcing of all our pharmaceutical products because of our resources were not
      sufficient and the project did not run as expected. Within short time he addressed capable and reliable suppliers
      in eastern Europe. With his help, we were able to meet the schedule. The savings by far exceeded our expectations.
      The cooperation was so good that we have since used Frank Jakob for optimization projects.&rdquo; <BR>Mag. Manfred
      Schafler, CEO Dr. A. &amp; L. Schmidgall GmbH &amp; Co KG

    <BR><BR>
    <h2>SCM Supply Chain Management</h2>
    <H3>
      SCM is understood as integrated planning, control and monitoring of the entire flow of information, materials and
      values from the supplier to the end customer. The lack of inter-departmental communication, suboptimal use of ERP
      systems and inadequate knowledge about how to interpret statistics are amongst the most frequent causes for
      persistent issues, such as excess inventories, failure to deliver on time and missing parts.
    </h3>
    <H3>
      I can help to enable you to overcome these issues and achieve sustainable success, step by step. There is no need
      for a conflict between your ability to deliver and the optimization of stock levels. I have successfully
      implemented concepts to achieve both at the same time in many projects.
    </h3>
    <H4>
      &rdquo;As an interim manager, Frank Jakob has significantly and permanently improved our capability to deliver
      instantly. And he achieved this while reducing stocks at the same time. In addition, he improved the effectiveness
      of our purchasing and logistics departments.&rdquo;<br>Dieter Berndt, CEO Qundis GmbH
    </h4>
    <H4>
      &rdquo;Frank Jakob analyzed our engine planning. We were able to implement his proposed solutions well and thus
      permanently reduce missing parts and stocks.&rdquo;<BR> Harald Schefft, Member of the Board, Caterpillar Marine
      Power Systems

    <h2>Production and Outsourcing</h2>
    <H3>
      Creating value while reducing waste at the same time poses a perpetual challenge in manufacturing. It is testing
      the boundaries of technical and logistical capabilities constantly. Therefore, it is imperative to strive for
      consistent improvement in order to maintain and build competitive advantages.
    </H3>
    <H3>
      The concept of "Lean" is only one of several important aspects. Production lines, machines and equipment have to
      be aligned to enable the optimal balance between investment and productivity. Where this cannot be achieved
      in-house, the choice of external supplier is critical.
    </H3>
    <H3>
      The most important aspect, however, is to motivate employees who are interested and open minded. Respect for the
      individual and constructive support create a productivity-enhancing environment.
      Employees with a negative attitude are a reason for concern. In Germany, this culture is relatively well
      developed. But countries like Finland, Norway and Switzerland have shown that there is still scope for
      development.
    </H3>
    <H4>
      &rdquo;Frank Jakob has supported us in the reorientation of our company. In particular the reorganization of
      production, the set up of activities in China and the implementation of socially-responsible workforce reduction
      plans in Germany. Mr. Jakob was always very well prepared and I could rely 100% on his proposals and conceptual
      plans. Together, we have conducted complex negotiations with the works council, trade unions and their
      lawyers.&rdquo; <BR>Andreas Albrecht, CEO, K&uuml;nkel-Wagner Prozesstechnologie GmbH</h4>

    <h2>Value Analysis</h2>
    <H3>Value analysis is the most important instrument to improve your company's competitive positioning. Each and
      every department has to contribute.<BR>
      While management sets objectives, marketing and sales translate these into processes and accounting analyses the
      results in terms of sales, costs and profits by activity....<BR>
      My experience and technical expertise can help you and your team realize substantial savings.</h3>

    <H4 align="justify">&rdquo;The business magazine brand eins and the market research institute Statista have selected
      the best consultants. Atreus receives the top mark in the area of interim management. Frank Jakobs personal work
      was essential for this. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Frank for his excellent service to our
      customers.&rdquo; <BR>Dr. Christian Frank, Partner and member of the Executive Boards, Atreus GmbH</h4>
